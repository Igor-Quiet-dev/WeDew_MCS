            <ul>
                <li class="li1">Novelty. A new, more complex activity stimulates the release of dopamine, which contributes to the growth of neurons. Go up the intellectual ladder. Every time complicate your task - solve more difficult puzzles, read smart books</li></ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Orientation. Poor know your city or even area? Fine! In terms of mental training. The development of new routes develops memory, attention and other cognitive functions.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Foreign languages. Mastering a second or third language improves memory, broadens one's horizons, and also protects the body from Alzheimer's disease.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Oral speech. If you say something out loud, it is better remembered. Proven scientific fact.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul> 
                <li>Positive thinking. Experts in positive psychology are inexorable and unanimous: think about the good and become smarter.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>When you are comfortable and happy with everything, chemicals that cause a good mood are released in the brain. But in the long run, comfort does not benefit him.
                It is the willingness to leave the comfort zone that keeps the brain young. Strive for new experiences, develop new skills and be open to new ideas.
                Without mental work, dendrites - the processes of neurons that transmit information - contract or completely disappear. Active life enhances dendritic networks and the regenerative capacity of the brain, known as plasticity.
                Leaving the comfort zone, you “stretch” your brain, and dendrites grow like trees with many branches.</li>

          <h1 class="H" >Yoga</h1>
            <ul> 
                <li>It has been proven that regular classes help get rid of problems with memory and concentration. Yoga practice can prevent and even cure Alzheimer's disease. Amazing</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Medical studies show that regular yoga classes are indeed as effective in treating back pain / stiffness as medications. Although in some cases, classes give a better result.
                Wouldn't it be nice to move without pain?</li> 
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Like any other form of physical activity, regular practice will provide you with a charge of energy for a long time. Much more than any power engineer can give, the effect of which quickly disappears.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>In addition to achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, yoga contributes to the formation of lean (lean) muscle mass, and also helps to develop and tone already existing muscles.
                But do not be afraid to become too inflated, just your body will acquire a beautiful silhouette!</li>
            </ul>
            <ul> 
                <li>Yoga is a type of physical activity with a low load. This means that even those who have health problems, as well as older people, can practice it.
                However, although this is soft, it is still a load. Therefore, if you have any kind of disease, be sure to consult your doctor first. And if there are no contraindications, sign up for the beginner group!</li></ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Yoga leads to a significant increase in the intellectual abilities of a person. Yoga practice helps to establish the correct interhemispheric interaction of the brain, forms the integrity and interconnection of all mental processes, affects spatial thinking, teaches a creative, flexible approach to any task, improves the quality and volume of attention, improves memory</li>

        <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Water. The body is 80% water. Every organ needs it, but the brain in particular. In the course of the next scientific experiment, it was found that people who are thirsty do worse with logical tasks than those who drank half a liter of water before testing.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Omega 3. Unsaturated fatty acids are super useful. Including for the brain and nervous system. They provide a quick influx of energy necessary for the transfer of impulses from cell to cell, which, in turn, increases mental ability and helps to quickly extract the necessary information from the "memory tanks". Lots of omega-3s in fish, walnuts, and linseed oil.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Greenery. Spinach and other greens contain folic acid, vitamins E and K. These substances inhibit the development of dementia (dementia). In addition, the antioxidants in the greens protect the brain from stroke, Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s diseases.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Apples They contain quercetin - a substance with antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory and other beneficial effects. But for us, the main thing is that quercetin protects brain cells from damage, and therefore, prevents the violation of its cognitive properties. Most of it in apple peel.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Nuts. They are rich in protein, and protein supplies the brain with energy. In addition, nuts are rich in lecithin, a lack of which in the body can cause multiple sclerosis and other nervous diseases.</li>
            </ul>  
            <ul>
                <li>Vitamins B9 and B12 - without these substances normal functioning of the body is impossible. The first is necessary to create and maintain new cells in a healthy state, and the second reduces the symptoms of senile dementia and confusion of thinking.</li>
            </ul>
